## Developer Guide ##

We decided we awanted to create a mobile apps game early on in the project. We were thinking about 
making an Augmented Reality(AR) game simalar to Pokemon Go, but after a some of research and testing code for AR, we 
realised that there was a lot of trial and error to get any small part of an Augmented Reality functionality working. 
We then decided that we would make an Endless Runner Game, and divided the project into two parts the character and the environment.
James worked on the character and Liam worked on the envionment.

We also decided that Unity was the best option for us because we had used it as part of one of our modules in college and 
we were very interested in learning more about it. We chose Unity to develop in because we wanted to make a modern 3D game 
that we could still work on after our college project was done.
